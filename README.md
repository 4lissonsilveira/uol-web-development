# UOL - Web Development - Team assignment
## Introduction to the team work exercise
Over the first half of the session, your team will design and build a web site for a fictitious theme park. The team will develop the web site in four stages. In this first part, you will design the web site using the wireframe method that you have explored in this topic. In the next parts, in Topics 3, 4 and 5, you will build the HTML pages, add the content and then style a large-screen and small-screen mobile version of the site. Read the instruction for part 1 of the team project, organise your teamwork and submit the completed material for peer review. We recommend to make a submission within one week. When you are ready, return to week 4 and make a submission in 'Peer-graded Assignment: 2.4.3 Team assignment. Part 1'
