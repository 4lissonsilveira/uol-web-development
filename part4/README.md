# Part 4
- **Markup wireframes with Layout CSS**
    - Review the three wireframes that you produced for the large screen version of your web site from part 3 of the team project and add to them to ensure that they have the layout that you wish your site to have. In particular identify the HTML elements' absolute and relative positions taking the element enclosing hierarchy in your web site. Use the various ways of measuring elements on web pages as appropriate. Additionally, identify the boxes that enclose the HTML elements in your web site and consider the box properties (padding borders etc) that you want to define.
    - Work through the wireframes and decide on the correct CSS to build those pages, and check the class and identity properties of the elements in the pages. Mark up your wireframes accordingly. Upload these new marked-up versions of the wireframes a .zip file into the Workspace: static web pages in week 10.
- **Set up and link stylesheet**
    - Code the CSS stylesheet with the layout styling instructions and link them to the correct HTML elements using the class and id mechanism.
