The homepage covers a lot of information, separating then vertically.
The main menu also has a lot of options, having the main ones as the:
- The Parc
    - Attractions
- Practical Information
    - Schedules and Calendar
    - Park Map
- Book Now pop-up
- Adventure

I'm not going into detail, but if I had to narrow down to indispensable options
I'd have the Home Page, Attractions, Schedule And Calendar, Park Map and Tickets.
The web site has a Chat Option as well, which is very important in my option.
