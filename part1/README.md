# Part 1 - Design Specification

### 1 - Agree on the purpose of the web site

Discuss the reasons for a theme park operator to have a web site, the people who might look at such a web site and the reasons that they would be looking at the web site.

### 2 - Research theme park web sites

As a group, choose five different web sites of theme parks. Review the type of information that you find on the sites, and the structure that these sites have to help people find that information. Make a list of the aspects of the sites that you think are a good idea or that work well, and a list of the aspects of the sites that you don't think are so successful. This will give you some insights that you can use when designing your own web site. Keep a record of the discussion in a document.

### 3 - Agree on the content for the web site

Agree within the group the theme for your theme park and the types of attractions that you will have for the different visitors that you expect to come to your theme park. Think of any other services that you will provide to visitors (for example food, access to money and medical help). Think of any other information that people looking at your web site will want to know before they come and visit your theme park. Keep a record of the discussion in a document.

### 4 - Agree on the structure of the web site

Agree within your group the structure of your web site, with the aim of designing a web site with 3 pages. What information will appear on the main page, and what will appear on the other two pages? Think about how you might present the content, and whether you will have semantic parts such as asides or pop-up windows. Keep a record of the discussion in a document.

### 5 - Design the wireframes for the web site

Produce a set of wireframes for the site, showing the concepts for both a wide screen and small screen. These can either be drawn by hand or produced using a tool such as PowerPoint or a graphics package such as Illustrator. Avoid painting or photo-editing software such as Paint or Photoshop as designs produced in this way are difficult to edit. Ensure that the designs are clear and easy to read.
