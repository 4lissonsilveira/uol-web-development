# Part 3
- **Markup wireframes with Appearance CSS**
    - Review the three wireframes that you produced for the large screen version of your web site from part 2 of the team project and add to them to ensure that they have the appearance that you wish your site to have. Ensure that you have agreed the colours that will be applied to the elements. Agree the font family or specific font that you will use for different parts of your site, and the colours that should be used.
    - Work through the wireframes and decide on the correct CSS to build those pages, and add classes and identities to the pages. Mark up your wireframes accordingly. Upload a .zip file of these new marked-up versions of the wireframes into the Workspace: static web pages in week 10.
- **Set up and link stylesheet**
    - Code the CSS stylesheet with these appearance styling instructions and link them to the correct HTML elements using the class and id mechanism.
